# Solar Client (OG. Keystrokes for EaglerForge)

Solar Client is a EaglerForge Client/Mod Menu made with their API/SDK and Javascript only. Solar Client includes safe mods for servers that won't get you banned! Even though Solar Client might not have many mods there will be more to come. [**Download EaglerForge Here**](https://github.com/eaglerforge/EaglerForge-builds/releases).

Mod Menu Keybind as of now is **Right Shift**. (Customization will come soon)
